/**
 * Error Boundary to catch error in React Components.
 * This Component can be used to wrap areas of the React App and catch any errors that occur inside them.
 *
 * Example:- A graph can be wrapped and the title can be set to "Invalid Data" to make sure that the users sees
 * this message instead of a blank screen if an error occurs.
 *
 * This will not affect the dev servers and the errors will still be shown.
